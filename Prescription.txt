Hello! My name is Aranya, and I'm a pharmacist. Thank you for choosing our pharmacy to fill your prescription today. I'm here to provide you with some information about your medications and how to use them properly.

Your prescription includes metformin, amlodipine, and aspirin. Metformin is used to help control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Amlodipine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, and aspirin is a blood thinner that is commonly used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.

Here are some important counseling points to keep in mind:

Take metformin exactly as directed by your doctor. You should take one tablet three times a day, preferably with meals. Be sure to follow your doctor's instructions regarding the timing of your doses.

Amlodipine should be taken once a day in the morning, with or without food. It's important to take it at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels.

Aspirin should also be taken once a day in the morning, with or without food. It's important to take it at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood levels.

If you experience any side effects while taking these medications, such as dizziness, headache, or upset stomach, be sure to let your doctor know.

Be sure to continue taking these medications even if you feel well. Do not stop taking them without first consulting your doctor.

If you miss a dose of any of these medications, take it as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule.

Store your medications in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

If you have any questions or concerns about your medications, don't hesitate to ask me or your doctor. Thank you for choosing our pharmacy, and please let us know if there's anything else we can do to assist you.
